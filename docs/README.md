# Docs

## Overview

The docs folder contains two subfolders - `user` and `contributor`. 
The `user` subfolder contains the end-user documentation, including any overview, usage or troubleshooting documents. The content of this folder is displayed on the [Kyma website](https://kyma-project.io/#/)

The `contributor` subfolder includes any developer-related documentation that can help in improving the given module's usage.

All documents must be properly numbered according to the structure proposed in [this decision record](https://github.tools.sap/kyma/community/issues/180).
